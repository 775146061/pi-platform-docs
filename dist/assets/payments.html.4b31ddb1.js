The Payment Flow UI opens, but cannot be interacted with until the payment is approved by your server.</p></li><li><p><code>onReadyForServerApproval</code>: The JS SDK has obtained the payment identifier (PaymentID) and is passing it to your app for Server-Side approval.</p></li><li><p>Your app&#39;s frontend sends the PaymentID to your app&#39;s server. This implementation is your responsibility.</p></li><li><p>Server-Side Approval: Your app&#39;s server approves the payment with Pi Servers through the <code>/approve</code> API call. This enables the user to submit the blockchain transaction.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Phase II - User interaction and blockchain transaction</strong></p><p>At this stage, the payment dialog becomes interactive and enables the user to confirm the transaction, sign it, and submit it to the Pi blockchain.</p><p>You do not have anything to do at this stage, everything is handled by the Pi Apps Platform and the Pi Wallet.</p><p>After the blockchain transaction is submitted, the payment flow will not close. You need to acknowledge the payment through Server-Side completion before your app is visible again.</p><p><strong>Phase III - Server-Side Completion</strong></p><ol start="5"><li><p><code>onReadyForServerCompletion</code>: The JS SDK passes the blockchain transaction identifier (TxID) to your app&#39;s frontend. You need this value for the Server-Side Completion flow.</p></li><li><p>Your app&#39;s frontend sends the TxID to your app&#39;s server. This implementation is your responsibility.</p></li><li><p>Server-Side Completion: Your app&#39;s server acknowledges the payment with Pi Servers through the <code>/complete</code> API call. This enables you to check whether the blockchain transaction has actually happened, and to let Pi know that you&#39;re aware of it.</p></li><li><p>The payment flow closes. Your app is now visible to the user again. Your app&#39;s server and your app&#39;s frontend can exchange data, and update the app interface to show a confirmation screen to the user. This implementation is your responsibility.</p></li></ol><blockquote><p><strong>The user might be lying to your app!</strong></p><p>Users might be running a hacked version of the SDK, pretending that they have made a payment.
